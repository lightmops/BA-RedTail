TLCI startup procedure.

THIS IS IMPORTANT.

DO NOT DELETE FILES FROM THIS FOLDER, OTHERS WILL WANT THEM AS WELL.

DO NOT RUN THE SOFTWARE FROM THIS FOLDER. It will generate files which could interfere with other users of the software.

COPY the entire contents of this folder to a single folder on your PC. 

Full instructions on how to use the software are in the pdf help files.

The software is written in BBC Basic for Windows, and tested on Windows XP and Windows 7. It may well work on other Windows versions, but there is no guarantee.

This is the full version of the software, which can be passed on to others. Only 'User' functions are available without payment.

The 'Engineering' version allows many more display modes than does the 'User' version, and full control over all the mathematics of the TLCI and CRI.
Normally, to access the Engineering mode (needed only for exploration of the concepts), please contact either:

Alan Roberts at roberts.mugswell@btinternet.com

or:

John Emmett at je@bpr.org.uk

There is a charge of £100 for the instructions on how to access Engineering mode, to defray some of the cost of developing the software and the algorithm.

The versions of the software here are beta, prior to publication. I believe them to be bug-free, but if you have evidence to the contrary, please let me know and I'll investigate.
